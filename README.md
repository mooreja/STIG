STIG Automated Lockdown Scripts

This repo is a bucket for automated STIG lockdown scripts.  I previously created a STIG repo that was consumed by another project but that project has a specific project view and I want to have a repo that is more open for community use.

Currently I only have one automated compliance check particially completed for Ubuntu and will push that up ASAP.  I will continue to update and hope to complete over the course of the next few weeks.
